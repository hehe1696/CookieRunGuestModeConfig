# CookieRunGuestModeConfig
 A user-friendly tool for modifying Guest Mode in legacy versions of Cookie Run for Kakao (1.0â€“4.21)

 **USE >>>** https://hehe1696.github.io/CookieRunGuestModeConfig/

 Guest Mode is an option in old versions of Cookie Run for Kakao to play versions of the game offline, but the player is forced to use a Level 1 Brave Cookie as the Cookie and Drop of Choco as the Pet. This tool allows you to modify the Guest Mode to use any Cookies or Pets you desire, in addition to other settings such as modifications of Energy/Jelly/BONUS Level or adding Relay / Fast Start. All that's needed is for the user to import an ipa/apk corresponding to the version of the game the user wants to modify, and the program will modify the files to apply any of the selected features. The game will warn the user if anything selected will cause the game to crash, such as if the selected content is only in a later version of the game.

**Features:**
 - All Cookies up to ch34 (Lv.1-8)
 - All Pets up to pet44 (Lv.1-8)
 - A Relay Cookie
 - Optional Fast Start / Relay boosts
 - Starting Energy Boost (Lv.1-50)
 - Jelly Score Boost (Lv.1-40)
 - BONUSTIME Length Boost (Lv.1-40)

**Additional Settings:**

There is a list of extra settings the user can choose to enable or disable, which range from additional Boosts to settings that may affect Guest Mode entirely.
 - **Please note the "Cookie Skill Slots taken" counter, as it displays how many available skill slots the current Cookie has. If your extra settings make it go over, then some settings you applied will not show.** Also note that skill slots for the Relay will still apply but will not be shown, so check the skill slots of the Relay by changing the first Cookie.
 - All Pets that place a Jelly take up two Skill Slots, so if you're enabling Setting #5 (+9 Lifts from a hole), it will only show if the version of the game you're using has at least 3 Skill Slots. Note that the Cookie and Pet have the same amount of Skill Slots.
 - Setting #6, or "Custom skills for Pet22/Pet25" will give custom skills to the two unused Pets Banana Potion and Mr. Pizza. **If Pet25 (Mr. Pizza) is selected, the game will crash unless this setting is enabled.**
 - Setting #7, or "Fix Rockstar Music" will swap the normal running music for Rockstar Cookie's music. This is because in Guest Mode, Rockstar's music normally does not work properly and the default running music is used instead. Please note that when using this setting, the music will also apply to the Relay.

**Limitations:**
 - Only versions of Cookie Run for Kakao from 1.0 to 4.21 will work, as the method of encryption is changed after 4.21
 - Treasures or other misc. Boosts cannot be added since they don't show (other settings for useful buffs are included to help combat this)
 - Some settings will not be visible when playing Guest Mode such as the Relay icon, but will still function properly
