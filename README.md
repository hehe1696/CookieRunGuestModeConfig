# CookieRunGuestModeConfig
 A user-friendly tool for modifying Guest Mode in legacy versions of Cookie Run for Kakao (1.0â€“4.21)

 Guest Mode is an option in old versions of Cookie Run for Kakao to play versions of the game offline, but the player is forced to use a Level 1 Brave Cookie as the Cookie and Drop of Choco as the Pet. This tool allows you to modify the Guest Mode to use any Cookies or Pets you desire, in addition to other settings such as modifications of Energy/Jelly/BONUS Level or adding Relay / Fast Start. All that's needed is for the user to import an ipa/apk corresponding to the version of the game the user wants to modify, and the program will modify the files to apply any of the selected features. The game will warn the user if anything selected will cause the game to crash, such as if the selected content is only in a later version of the game.

**Features:**
 - All Cookies up to ch34 (Lv.1-8)
 - All Pets up to pet44 (Lv.1-8)
 - A Relay Cookie
 - Optional Fast Start / Relay boosts
 - Starting Energy Boost (Lv.1-50)
 - Jelly Score Boost (Lv.1-40)
 - BONUSTIME Length Boost (Lv.1-40)
   
 **Limitations:**
 - Only versions of Cookie Run for Kakao from 1.0 to 4.21 will work, as the method of encryption is changed after 4.21
 - Treasures or other misc. Boosts cannot be added since they don't show (other settings for useful buffs are included to help combat this)
 - Some settings will not be visible when playing Guest Mode such as the Relay icon, but will still function properly
