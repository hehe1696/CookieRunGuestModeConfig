# CookieRunGuestModeConfig
 A user-friendly tool for modifying Guest Mode in legacy versions of Cookie Run for Kakao (1.0â€“4.21)

 Guest Mode is an option in old versions of Cookie Run for Kakao to play versions of the game offline, but the player is forced to use a Level 1 Brave Cookie and Choco Drop. This tool allows you to modify the Guest Mode to use any Cookies or Pets you desire, in addition to other settings such as modifications of Energy/Jelly/BONUS Level or adding Relay / Fast Start. 

 **Limitations:**
 - Only versions of Cookie Run for Kakao from 1.0 to 4.21 will work, as the method of encryption is changed after 4.21
 - Treasures or other misc. Boosts cannot be added since they don't show (other settings for useful buffs are included to help combat this)
 - Some settings will not be visible when playing Guest Mode such as the Relay icon, but will still function properly

Special thanks to ProblematicPeriwinklePlum for creating the sprite sheets for pet22 and pet25 (present in Extras folder)
